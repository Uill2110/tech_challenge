# Tech Challenge Fase 1: Medical Diagnosis AI Assistant

## Project Overview
This project implements an initial AI-powered system to assist in medical diagnosis using machine learning on tabular data. The goal is to classify patients based on their medical parameters to predict the presence or absence of a specific disease. For this demonstration, we use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset to classify tumors as benign or malignant.

## Deliverables
- Source code organized in a modular structure.
- Jupyter Notebook (`notebooks/main_analysis.ipynb`) demonstrating the full analysis, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Dockerfile` for easy environment setup and execution.
- `README.md` with setup and execution instructions.
- Results presented with visualizations and critical discussion.
